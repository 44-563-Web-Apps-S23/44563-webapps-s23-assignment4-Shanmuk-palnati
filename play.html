        <h3>HYACINTH HALVEY by LADY AUGUSTA GREGORY</h3>
        <p>MRS. DELANE. Good evening to you, Miss Joyce. What way is his reverence
            to-day? Did he get any ease from the cough?<p>

            <p>MISS JOYCE. He did not, indeed, Mrs. Delane. He has it sticking to him
            yet. Smothering he is in the night-time. The most thing he comes short
            in is the voice.</p>

            <p> MRS. DELANE. I am sorry, now, to hear that. He should mind himself well.</p>

            <p>MISS JOYCE. It's easy to say let him mind himself. What do you say to
            him going to the meeting to-night?</p>

            <p>[SERGEANT _comes in_.</p>

            <p>MISS JOYCE. It's for his reverence's "Freeman" I am come, Mrs. Delane.</p>

            <p>MRS. DELANE. Here it is ready. I was just throwing an eye on it to see
            was there any news. Good evening, Sergeant.</p>

            <p>SERGEANT. [_Holding up a placard._] I brought this notice, Mrs. Delane,
            the announcement of the meeting to be held to-night in the court-house.
            You might put it up here convenient to the window. I hope you are coming
            to it yourself?</p>
