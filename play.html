        <h4 class="delane">MRS. DELANE.</h4> 
        <p class="speech">Good evening to you, Miss Joyce. What way is his reverence
            to-day? Did he get any ease from the cough?<p>

                <h4 class="joyce">MISS JOYCE.</h4>
                <p class="speech"> He did not, indeed, Mrs. Delane. He has it sticking to him
            yet. Smothering he is in the night-time. The most thing he comes short
            in is the voice.</p>

            <h4 class="delane"> MRS. DELANE.</h4>
            <p class="speech"> I am sorry, now, to hear that. He should mind himself well.</p>

                <h4 class="joyce"> MISS JOYCE.</h4>
                <p class="speech"> It's easy to say let him mind himself. What do you say to
            him going to the meeting to-night?</p>

            <p class="direction">[SERGEANT _comes in_.]</p>

                <h4 class=""joyce> MISS JOYCE. </h4>
                <p class="speech">It's for his reverence's "Freeman" I am come, Mrs. Delane.</p>

                    <h4 class="delane"> MRS. DELANE.</h4>
                    <p class="speech"> Here it is ready. I was just throwing an eye on it to see
            was there any news. Good evening, Sergeant.</p>

            <h4 class="sergeant"> SERGEANT. </h4>
            <p class="direction">[_Holding up a placard._]</p>
            <p class="speech"> I brought this notice, Mrs. Delane,
            the announcement of the meeting to be held to-night in the court-house.
            You might put it up here convenient to the window. I hope you are coming
            to it yourself?</p>
